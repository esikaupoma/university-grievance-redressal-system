# Grievance-Redressal-System

We have created a web application, 'Grievance Redressal System', for our university, 'East-West University', using the Django framework. The 'Grievance Redressal System' is another term for a 'Complaint Management System'. With this increasing number of students, managing all the complaints manually is very difficult. Therefore, the system is developed to manage all the complaints systematically online. The main objective of this web application is to provide a platform for the students and faculties to register their grievances to the concerned authorities.
The system has four end users:
1. Student
2. Faculty
3. Handling Authority and
4. Processing Authority

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration for students and administrators.
- **Complaint Management**: Students can file new complaints, view the status of their complaints, and receive updates.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Administrators can view, manage, and resolve complaints. 
- **Notification System**: Automatic email notifications to students about the status of their complaints.
- **Search and Filter**: Advanced search and filter options for complaints.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Django 4.1.7
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
